# Ledger Objects

These are all ledger objects as defined in https://xrpl.org/ledger-object-types.html

Just doing out by hand again.

These are very much in progress, and many fields are marked optional that are always there.
Probably missing some fields too :-/



LedgerNode is the root state node.
