  * Some utility functions for extracting the current balance of accounts in a payment transaction.
  * Extracts from AccountTx and Tx meta entries - the ledger nodes.
  * This is limited to Payment Transactions for now --- and simple Xrp -> Xrp and Fiat -> Fiat (not forex).
  * Also haven't looked how Rippling will effect it.
  *
  * This is used to get running balances per transaction, normally you would sequence the transaction by time and/or
  * sequence number of the transaction in the account.
  *
  * A transaction has a send and receiver. Balances change on both.
  * This extracts all changes, and you filter by account (and currency).
  * Note that other transactions also effect the XRP balance in terms of transaction fees being deducted.
  * But, the use case for this is running balances for transactions, just doing XRP because it is interesting
  * for some strange use cases (however the real interest for XRP is the available abalance san reserve fees)
